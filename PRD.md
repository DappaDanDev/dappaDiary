## Product Requirements Document: NotebookLM Recreation

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the product requirements for recreating NotebookLM, an AI-powered research and note-taking tool developed by Google Labs. NotebookLM leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide contextually relevant and grounded responses based on user-uploaded sources. This PRD aims to capture the core functionality, technical architecture, and user interface elements necessary for a successful recreation.

**2. Goals**

*   Replicate the core features of NotebookLM, allowing users to upload various document formats and interact with them using AI.
*   Implement a robust RAG system to ensure AI responses are grounded in the provided sources and minimize hallucinations.
*   Design a user-friendly interface that facilitates efficient document management, information retrieval, and content creation.
*   Establish a database architecture capable of securely storing user documents and conversation history [Database Storage].
*   Potentially explore the integration of AI Agents to streamline content processing workflows [AI Agents for Workflows].

**3. Target Users**

*   Researchers.
*   Students.
*   Educators.
*   Professionals and knowledge workers.
*   Software developers.
*   Anyone who needs to analyze and synthesize information from multiple sources.

**4. Core Features**

*   **Notebook Creation and Management:**
    *   Users can create multiple notebooks to organize their sources by project or topic.
    *   Ability to name, rename, and delete notebooks.
    *   Option to view notebooks in list or grid format.
*   **Source Document Upload and Management:**
    *   Support for uploading various file formats, including PDFs, text files, and potentially website URLs, YouTube videos, Google Docs, and Google Slides.
    *   Limit on the number of sources per notebook (e.g., up to 50) and the size of each source (e.g., 500,000 words).
    *   Ability to view and review uploaded source documents within the application.
    *   Option to delete sources from a notebook.
    *   For web-based sources, a mechanism to handle potential blocking and allow manual text input as an alternative.
    *   For Google Docs and Slides, a "resync" functionality to update the content.
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System:**
    *   **Indexing:** Upon upload, source documents are processed and indexed to create embeddings or other suitable representations for efficient semantic search.
    *   **User Query Processing:** User queries are also processed to create embeddings.
    *   **Information Retrieval:** The system performs a semantic search across the indexed sources to find the most relevant content snippets based on the user's query.
    *   **Contextualization:** The retrieved relevant snippets are then fed into a large language model (LLM) along with the user's query to generate a response grounded in the sources.
    *   **Citation:** The AI-generated responses include clear citations, linking back to the specific sections or sources in the uploaded documents from which the information was derived. Users can click on citations to view the corresponding source.
*   **Chat Interface (Instant Insights):**
    *   A text-based chat interface where users can ask questions and interact with the AI based on their uploaded sources.
    *   Support for free-form questions related to the content of the uploaded sources.
    *   Display of AI-generated answers with citations to the source material.
    *   Potential inclusion of suggested questions to help users get started.
    *   Ability to save useful AI responses as notes.
*   **Notebook Guide:**
    *   An opinionated approach to the content, providing automated features.
    *   **Summary Generation:** Automatically generate a concise summary of all the sources in a notebook.
    *   **Key Topics Extraction:** Identify and present the main themes and concepts present in the uploaded sources. Clicking on key topics can prompt the AI to expand on them.
    *   **Pre-created Templates:** Offer situational templates like FAQs and briefing documents that the AI can generate based on the sources.
    *   **Podcast Generation (Audio Overviews):**
        *   Ability to generate an AI-powered audio discussion (podcast) between two AI hosts based on the uploaded sources.
        *   The audio overview summarizes the information and explores connections between topics.
        *   Option to customize the podcast by providing specific instructions or targeting a specific audience.
        *   The audio aims to sound conversational with micro-interjections, pauses, and varying perspectives.
        *   Potential for interactive podcast features where users can ask questions during playback (future enhancement).
*   **Notes:**
    *   Users can create and save notes within each notebook for important information, summaries, or personal reflections.
    *   Option to create new blank notes and manually add content.
    *   Ability to save AI-generated responses as notes.
    *   Support for selecting multiple notes for combined actions.
    *   Features to combine selected notes, create study guides, generate outlines, suggest related ideas, or summarize them.
    *   Option to convert notes into standalone source documents.
*   **Content Studio (Implicit in Notebook Guide and Chat):**
    *   The underlying system that allows for different ways to interact with the data beyond simple Q&A, enabling the creation of new content formats like summaries and podcasts.
*   **Collaboration (Future Enhancement):**
    *   Potential for sharing notebooks with other users with different access levels (view or edit).
*   **Output Generation (Beyond Audio):**
    *   Exploration of features to generate other output formats like outlines, study guides, timelines, and briefing documents.

**5. Potential AI Agents for Workflows**

*   **Intelligent Source Analysis Agent:** Automatically analyze uploaded documents to identify their type, key topics, and suggest relevant follow-up questions or potential output formats (e.g., "This looks like a research paper; would you like a summary or a podcast overview?").
*   **Personalized Learning Agent:** Based on user interactions and saved notes, an agent could proactively generate study guides, flashcards, or suggest related concepts for deeper learning.
*   **Content Transformation Agent:** Guide users through the process of transforming selected sources into a specific output format (e.g., "You've selected these meeting transcripts; would you like a summary, a list of action items, or a briefing document for stakeholders?").
*   **Podcast Customization Agent:** Assist users in tailoring the audio overview by offering options for speaker personas, focus areas, and desired tone.

**6. Database Storage**

*   **Long-Term Document Storage:**
    *   A secure and scalable database (e.g., cloud-based object storage) to store user-uploaded source documents.
    *   Metadata associated with each document (e.g., upload date, file name, source type, notebook ID).
    *   Indexed representations of the documents for the RAG system.
*   **Short-Term Conversation Storage:**
    *   A database (e.g., NoSQL database) to store user interactions (queries and AI responses) within each notebook.
